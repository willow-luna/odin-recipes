    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Whip eggs in bowl and add pinch of salt and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in large saucepan. Add enough egg to cover pan in thin layer. Cook until egg has set, then flip and cook for additional 1 minute. Try not to brown the eggs. Remove from pan and repeat with remaining egg. Let cool and thinly cut into 3 inch long strips.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok on medium low heat and saute shrimp for 3 to 4 minutes. When cooked through, remove from wok and place in bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut chicken into bite-sized (approximately 1 inch) pieces. In a medium-sized bowl combine chicken with 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce, 2 teaspoons of cooking sake, a pinch of dashi powder, and 1 teaspoon of corn starch. Mix together thoroughly and let marinade for 15 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in wok on medium heat and saute chicken until cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Top with splash of unagi sauce. Remove from wok and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining oil and fresh ginger. Saute for about 1 minute or until until fragrant. Add cabbage and carrots, and saute for an additional 8 to 10 minutes. Add green onions and mushrooms and saute for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the vegetables are almost done cooking, heat a pot filled with about an inch of water until hot. Add yakisoba noodles and gently loosen. Do not overcook; the purpose of this step is only to loosen the noodles. Drain from the water once loosened.</li>
        <li>When vegetables are cooked and soft, add shrimp, chicken, and noodles. Sprinkle powdered sauce into the noodles until dissolved and evenly distributed, being careful not to break the noodles.</li>
        <li>Serve yakisoba in a large bowl. Top with sliced egg, sesame seeds, beni shouga and kizami nori.</li>
    
    </ol>
