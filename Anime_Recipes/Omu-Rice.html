    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 bowls of warm rice (about 1 cup of dried rice)</li>
        <li>¼ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>½ onion, diced</li>
        <li>50g chicken, cut into bite size pieces</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon concentrated chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>100 ml water</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a pan. Fry chicken and diced onion until the chicken is browned and the onion begins to soften and become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add a chicken stock, ketchup, sugar, and water to a pan. Bring to a boil, stirring from time to time, until the mixture thickens. Do not brown. Stir in peas.</li>
        <li>Add rice and mix gently until incorporated, making sure not to break the rice grains into small pieces. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat up a frying pan with butter. While it's heating, mound half the fried rice on a plate and arrange it in the shape of an oval with it's two ends tapering to points. Beat the eggs in a bowl until thoroughly mixed, seasoning to taste.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the pan and let rest on a medium low heat until soldified on the bottom, swirling the uncooked egg around the pan to ensure it is evenly distributed. Be careful not to brown the egg. Once just solidified on the bottom of the pan, add the other half of the rice along the center of the egg. Fold the top and bottom portions of the egg towards the middle. Flip the omellette onto the plate.</li>
        <li>Decorate with ketchup and mayo. Serve while hot.</li>
