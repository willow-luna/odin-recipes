            <li>1 tbsp matcha</li>

    <h2>Baking Directions:</h2>    

        <h3>Sponge:</h3>

        <ol>
           <li>Preheat oven to 340 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Line the bottom and sides of 14.5 x 10.5 rimmmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Mix together cake flour and coco powder. sift 2-3 times to incorporate coco into the flour evenly and so as to prevent any clumping.</li>
            <li>Using a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites until soft foam forms. Add half of the sugar for the egg whites, and whip until incorporated. Add the remaining sugar for the egg whites and whip until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, ligtly beat the egg yolks until smooth. add in sugar for the egg yolks, and beat until light, creamy, and pale. Using a whisk, incorporate the sifted flour and coco into the egg yolks.</li>
            <li>Gently use the whisk to mix one third of the whipped egg whites into the egg yolk and flour mixture. Switch to a spatula and, in two stages, gently fold in the remaining two thirds of the egg whites into the egg yolk-flour mixture, being careful not to deflated the bubbles in the whipped egg whites. </li>
            <li>Continue folding the batter until it becomes glossy and smoooth. This process may take up to 100 folds of the batter.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the batter inot the prepared rimmed baking sheet. Using a spatula, gently spread the batter to the edges, making sure it is evenly distributed throughout the sheet. Tap the sheet on the counter a few times to collapse any large air pockets inside the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 minutes, rotating the sheet half way through the baking time to ensure the cake is evenly cooked.</li>
            <li>Gently remove the sponge from the pan, leaving the parchment papger attached. Place the sponge on a flat board, and then cover to prevent it from drying out. Let it completely cool.</li>
        
        </ol>

        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>While the cake is cooling, beat the softened butter with vanilla extract until creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Then add the cream and beat until the mixture is smooth, creamy, and slightly fluffy.</li>
            <li>Next add all of the dry ingredients and mix at medium speed until incorporated.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Cake Assembly:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Gently remove the parchment paper from the sides of the sponge cake. Place a sheet of parchment over the top of the cake and flip it over so the bottom of the cake faces up. Carefully peel off the parchment paper clinging to the bottom of the cake. Replace the paper over the cake, and flip it once more so that the top of the cake faces up. Leave the cake sitting on the parchment paper.</li>
            <li> Position the cake so that the short side of the rectangular cake is closest to you. Use a serrated knife and cut the edge of the far side of the cake at a diagonal.</li>
            <li>Using an offset spatula, spread the whipped cream filling onto the top of the cake, leaving about 1.5-2 inches of the far end of the cake without filling. Sprinkle (optional) sweetened azuki beans on top of the filling.</li>
            <li>To roll the cake, fold the bottom of the cake over, and then use the parchment paper to tightly roll the cake towards the diagonal cut.

                Wrap tightly in parchment paper, using a ruler to push the paper tightly around the cake. Place the cake with the cut side down, and wrap the parchment paper wrapped cake in plastic wrap. Refrigerate cake until cold, about 1 hour.</li>
       
        </ol>
